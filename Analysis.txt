Task 0-In task zero i have simply printed two indexes using slicing principle which takes O(1) time complexity.
Task 1-In this task i have used 2 for loops so it will take O(n) time complexity
Task 2-In this task i have used 1 for loop so it will be take O(n) time complexity here i am not considering the time complexities of built-in methods.
Task 3-In this task i have used 1 for loop so it will be take O(n) time complexity here
task 4-In this task i have used 2 for loops so it will take O(n) time complexity here
